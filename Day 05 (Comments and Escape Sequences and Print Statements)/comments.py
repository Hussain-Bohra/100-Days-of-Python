# Welcome To 100 Days of Code.
# Today is Day 5.


# A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing.

# There are two types of Comments :-
# 1. Single line Comment.
# 2. Multi Line Comment.


# (#) symbol is used for single line comment
print ("Hello World")

print("Hello Earth") # we can also put comment after print statement like this.
