# To insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an escape sequence character.
# An escape sequence character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

# Examples :-
print("Hello Coders! \nHow are you All?") # \n means new line

print("\'Python\' is an Awesome Language.") # \' is used for single quote (')
