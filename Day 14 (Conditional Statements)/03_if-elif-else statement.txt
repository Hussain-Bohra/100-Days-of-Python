--> if-elif-else statements :-
• We can add multiple conditions using if-elif statements. It works like this if the condition of "if-statement" is false then check the condition of "elif statement" and if it is also false, then execute the code of else statement.

• Syntax :-
if(condition1):
    statement

elif(condition2):
    statement

else:
    statement


• Example :-
number = 25
if(number == 25):
    print(number,"is Equals to 25")

elif(number > 20):
    print(number,"is Greater than 20")

else:
    print(number,"is Less Than 20")


• Output :-
25 is Equals to 25
