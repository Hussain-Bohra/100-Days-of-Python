--> Python Supports following Operators in Conditional Statements :-
a == b    # Equals to
a > b     # Greater than
a >= b    # Greater than or Equals to
a < b     # Less than
a <= b    # Less than or Equals to
a != b    # Not Equals to 

--> If Statements :-
• If Statement is a conditional statement in python, that is used to determine whether a block of code will be execute or not, it means if the program finds the condition defined in the if-statement to be true, then it will execute the code written inside the if-statement.      
• We use 'if' keyword to write if-statement.

• Syntax :-
if (condition):
    #Indentation
    statement


• Example :-
age = 18
if(age >= 18):
    print("You are Eligible for Driving")

• Output :-
You are Eligible for Driving


--> Indentation :-
• You can see we use white spaces to write a print statement in if-condition block, that is called Indentation, and it is necessary because python relies on indentation to define the scope of code.
• Note: colon (:) is must after if, else, and elif conditions.
• Other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.
