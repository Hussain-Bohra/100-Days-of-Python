--> Match Case Statements :-
• Note: Match Case Statements only works in Python 3.10 version or above, so make sure to check your python version before running match case program.

• To implement switch-case like characteristics very similar to if-else functionality, we use a match case in python. If you are coming from a C, C++ or Java like language, you must have heard of switch-case statements. If python is your first language, dont worry as I will tell you everything you need to know about match case statements.

• A match statement will compare a given variable’s value to different shapes, also referred to as the pattern. The main idea is to keep on comparing the variable with all the present patterns until it fits into one.

• The match case consists of three main entities :

1. The match keyword :-
2. One or more case clauses
3. Expression for each case

• The case clause consists of a pattern to be matched to the variable, a condition to be evaluated if the pattern matches, and a set of statements to be executed if the pattern matches.

• Syntax :-
match variable_name:
            case ‘pattern1’:
                         //statement 1
            case ‘pattern2’:
                         //statement 2
            …            
            case ‘pattern n’:
                         //statement n
            case_:
                // default statement



• Example :-
x = 1

match x:
    # if x is 0
    case 0:
        print("x is zero")

    # if x is 1
    case 1:
        print("x is 1")

    # We can use if-condition with empty case
    case _ if x > 10:
        print(x, "is greater than 10")

    # default case(will only be matched if the above cases were not matched)
    # case _ is a default case or empty case
    # It is basically just an else:
    case _:
        print(x)


• Output :-
x is 1
